# Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis-using-Machine-Learning
This project analyzes sentiments from Twitter data using machine learning techniques. The goal is to classify tweets as positive, negative, or neutral based on their textual content. The project follows a complete machine learning workflow, including data collection, preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, and evaluation.
Tech stack used -
Programming Language: Python
Libraries & Tools: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, NLTK
Extracted tweets using APIs. Cleaned and tokenized text (removing stopwords, special characters, and stemming/lemmatization). Utilized TF-IDF, Word2Vec, or CountVectorizer for text representation. Trained multiple machine learning models including Na√Øve Bayes. Assessed model performance using accuracy, precision, recall.
